	   POTRACE - transform bitmaps into vector graphics

			  README for Windows
  _________________________________________________________________

This file contains instructions specific to the pre-compiled Windows
distribution of Potrace. Please see the general README file and the
man page for general information on usage, how to compile Potrace,
etc.


INSTALLATION for Windows:
=========================

Download the file potrace-XXX.win32.zip (or potrace-XXX.win64.zip if
you want the 64-bit version).  Unpack it with your favorite unzipping
tool, such as unzip, 7-Zip, WinZip, or just right-clicking on the
file.

If you have "tar" and "gunzip" installed, you may also get the tar.gz
file instead of the zip file.

The distribution includes the executable programs potrace.exe and
mkbitmap.exe. You need to move these files to a place where Windows
looks for programs, for example C:\WINDOWS. Alternatively, you can
amend your PATH environment variable, by adding something like the
following line to C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT:

        PATH=%PATH%;C:\DIRECTORY\WHERE\FILES\ARE


RUNNING:
========

For non-Windows specific usage information, see the file README.

Potrace on Windows runs in much the same way as under Linux and other
Unix-like operating systems. You must run Potrace from the command
line (also known as the MSDOS Prompt). File names can be given in Unix
style or Windows style, thus the following will both work:

 potrace h:/data/file.txt
 potrace h:\data\file.txt

Wildcards can also be used, as in:

 potrace h:\data\*.*
 potrace h:/data/*.*
